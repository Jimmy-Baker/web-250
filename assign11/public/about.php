    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We love birds. We love them so much that sometimes it hurts. They're just the most adorable, allure, and delightable things. All birds are special because they're able to live with one another and share a sense of connection and affection.</p>
    <p>To make things feel good you need to find something good, and not an evil thing; this can be one of the things that makes us sad. To be happy you need people with good will, good will and good intentions, and a willingness to look at things objectively.</p>
